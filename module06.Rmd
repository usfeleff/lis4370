Please see the discussion at https://thestorythusr.wordpress.com/2021/02/20/r-06-doing-math-pt-02/

```{r setup, message = FALSE}

```
Answer the following questions and post your answer on your blog:
1. Consider A=matrix(c(2,0,1,3), ncol=2) and B=matrix(c(5,2,4,-1), ncol=2).
a) Find A + B
b) Find A - B

```{R, "Module 06 Assignment | 1"}
A <- matrix(c(2,0,1,3), ncol=2); B <- matrix(c(5,2,4,-1), ncol=2)
# notice that these operations are element wise, they add or subtract
# the numbers in each matching "position" of the two matrices
# A[1,1] + B[1,1]; A[1,2] + B[1,2], etc.
A+B
A-B
```

#2. Using the diag() function to build a matrix of size 4 with the following values in the diagonal 4,1,2,3.
```{R, "Module 06 Assignment | 2"}
diag(c(4,1,2,3))
```
# 3. Generate the following matrix:

## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,] 3 1 1 1 1
## [2,] 2 3 0 0 0
## [3,] 2 0 3 0 0
## [4,] 2 0 0 3 0
## [5,] 2 0 0 0 3
# Hint: You can use the command diag() to build it.
```{R, "Module 06 Assignment | 3"}
# whole lot of ways to do this, so here is a quick one
# though I am not 100% sure it is less typing then
# manual entry
rbind(c(3,1,1,1,1),cbind(c(2,2,2,2),diag(3,nrow=4)))

```
